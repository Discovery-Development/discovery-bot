<h4 align="center">Tickets, Moderation, Suggestions, Image manipulation and much more. (This branch hasn't got it yet, but it will soon)</h4>

<h2 align="center">Overview</h2>
<p>The Discovery Discord Bot is an open-source Discord Bot. It has features like a Ticket System, Custom Guild Settings, a Warning System and much more! It is currently still in a very early phase of development, which means it is a little unstable but the features should make up for that.</p>

(The README page is still in progress, we're at least trying to have one.)
